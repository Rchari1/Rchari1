Currently, I am working towards my B.S. in Physics and I am Undergraduate Research Assistant at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am particularly interested in computational astrophysics, high performance computing, and numerical simulations. I'm experienced in various programming languages including C++, C, Python, CUDA, MATLAB, Fortran, and Linux.

## My Projects

**Fast Explicit Neutrino Networks (FENN)** - A C++ based high performance code designed for simulating neutrino networks at incredible speeds. It offers a new path for broader scientific applications and is intended to become an open-source community resource. [Check it out](https://github.com/Rchari1/FENN)

**Polluted Black Hole Accretion Code (PoBHAC)** - A C++ based numerical code designed to investigate polluted Black Hole accretion. Using advanced simulations, it aims to deepen our understanding of stellar pollution. [Check it out](https://github.com/Rchari1/PoBHAC)

## Recommended Reads

Books are a window to countless different worlds and perspectives. Here are a couple of my favorites that I highly recommend:

- [**Looking for Alaska**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/99561.Looking_for_Alaska) by John Green: An insightful and philosophical novel that delves into the themes of love, loss, and the quest for meaning.

- [**Nyxia**](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/27426044) by Scott Reintgen: A thought-provoking science fiction triad full of  mystery, and the ethical quandaries of technological advancement.
