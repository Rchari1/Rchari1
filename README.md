# Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Raghav Chari

- Physics student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville
- Undergraduate Research Assistant
- Undergraduate Teaching Assistant

Currently, I am working towards my B.S. in Physics and I am particularly interested in computational astrophysics, high performance computing, and numerical simulations. I'm experienced in various programming languages including C++, C, Python, CUDA, MATLAB, Fortran, and Linux. Find more about my research and academic projects on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Rchari1).

## My Projects

**Fast Explicit Neutrino Networks (FENN)** - A C++ based software suite designed for simulating neutrino networks. It offers a new path for broader scientific applications and is intended to become an open-source community resource. [Check it out](https://github.com/Rchari1/FENN)

## Publications

1. [Searching for Phase-Locked Variations of the Emission-Line Profiles in Binary Be Stars](https://doi.org/10.3390/galaxies11040083)
2. "Fast explicit solutions for astrophysical neutrino transport: Explicit asymptotic methods," - Manuscript in preparation, 2023.
3. [Neutrino Electron Scattering in Dense Astrophysical Environments: A New Frontier in Neutrino Transport](https://indico.frib.msu.edu/event/58/contributions/1518/)
4. [Spectral History Of The Bright Be Star Omicron Aquarii](https://baas.aas.org/pub/2021n6i316p06)
