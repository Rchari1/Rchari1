## About Me

I'm currently pursuing my B.S. in Physics and B.A. in Astrophysics & Philosophy of Physics at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. Concurrently, I work as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in collaboration with Oak Ridge National Labs. My research interests lie in theoretical astrophysics, computational astrophysics, high-performance computing, and numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae. Additionally, I work on numerical simulations of polluted black holes at Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

I have experience in various programming languages including C++, C, Python, CUDA, MATLAB, and Fortran.
