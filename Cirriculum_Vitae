\section{Physics Software Developed}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item \underline{F}ast \underline{E}xplicit \underline{N}eutrino \underline{N}etworks (FENN): FENN is a C++ based software suite designed for simulating neutrino networks. It provides efficient numerical solutions by using algebraically stabilized explicit methods, showing significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. Leveraging GPU acceleration, it executes large-scale thermonuclear networks faster than conventional methods. Initially applied to astrophysical scenarios, FENN offers a new path for broader scientific applications, with the intent of becoming an open-source community resource. FENN is avaliable through my Github: \url{https://github.com/Rchari1/FENN}

\section{Research Experience}

\cventry{September 2021 - Present}{Research Assistant and Fellow, Computational Astrophysics Group}{The University of Tennessee, Knoxville}{Knoxville, TN}{}{
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5em]
\item Worked under the mentorship of Professor Mike Guidry in developing computational algorithms for solving partial differential equations related to hydrodynamics, radiation transport, and thermonuclear reactions across multiple timescales.
\item Awarded the Department summer fellowship in 2022, during which I developed "FENN" (Fast Explicit Neutrino Networks) as part of my fellowship. FENN is a high-performance c++ code that approximates the Neutrino Transport problem. Details of this development are referenced above.
\item Worked on optimizing Neutrino Transport Algorithms for High Performance Computing (HPC) using algebraically stabilized explicit approximations and Implemented test cases for neutrino networks on GPU nodes through Oak Ridge National Labs SUMMIT Supercomputer.

\cventry{Summer 2023}{Research Assistant, Computational Astrophysics}{Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology}{Pasadena, CA}{}{
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5em]
\item Worked under the mentorship of Dr. Apurva Oza in developing the application of theories of stellar pollution, accretion disk dynamics, spallation reactions, and dust accretion to understand the accretion process of polluted Black Holes.
\item Used numerical simulation and analytical model to examine the possible tidal disruption events and subsequent accretion disk formation, ultimately making robust predictions on spallation products' detectability.
\item Developed extended models of accretion and spallation processes in the case of a simulated $10^{8} M_{\odot}$ Supermassive Black Hole utilizing a novel approach that expanded theories of accretion and spallation processes applied to icy exomoons.

\cventry{September 2020 - July 2023}{Research Assistant, Observational Astronomy}{The University of North Carolina at Greensboro}{Greensboro, NC}{}{
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.5em]
\item Conducted extensive spectral analysis over the course of 3 years to investigate the binarity of Be stars through spectroscopic analysis, identifying phase-locked variations in double-peaked emission-line profiles. Explored the temporal behavior of Balmer line profiles to detect orbital periods and provide insights into binary systems.
\item Under the mentorship of Professor Anatoly Mirshnichenko, Co-authored a paper titled "Searching for Phase-Locked Variations in Binary Be Stars" published in the journal, "Galaxies". Analyzed 12 Be stars, confirming orbital periods in some systems and suggesting potential binarity in others, using spectro-astrometry, photometric monitoring, and peak intensity variations.
